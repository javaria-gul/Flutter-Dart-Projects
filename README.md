Welcome to my development portfolio! This repository tracks my progress from basic Dart programming to building complex system architectures and security simulations.

## 🛠️ Project Categories

### 🔐 Security & Cryptography
* **Caesar Cipher**: A classic encryption-decryption tool using alphabet shifts.
* **PIN Brute-Force**: A simulation showing the computational time required to crack numeric PINs.
* **Security Auditor**: Password strength analyzer using Regular Expressions.

### 🏛️ Advanced Systems
* **Blockchain Ledger**: A basic implementation of blockchain technology showing block hashing and integrity.
* **Warehouse Manager**: An inventory system using OOP (Classes & Objects).
* **GPA Tracker**: A student record system with merit-sorting logic.

### 🧪 Foundation Labs
* **Smart Calculator**: Arithmetic operations with user input loop.
* **ATM Simulator**: Logic for transactions and PIN verification.
